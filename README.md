# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hi my name is Hayley and my pronouns are she/her. I like to play shooter and puzzle games, specifically I have been addicted to Overwatch 2 but I am trying to battle this and find a new game.I am taking the class because it is a requirement as a GDIM major but also I want to improve my coding skills with what little knowledege I do have. I have very beginner level experience with game development when I took a 2 week all girl summer program after my sophmore year of high school where we coded different types of projects like mazes, storygames, and flappybird. I really enjoyed it and I know as a game designer it is best to learn how to do a little bit of everything. I'm hoping to build story games that might reel in the older generation who currently criticize the whole gaming community.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I am hoping to gain enough experience to comfortably code my own games and understand different coding languages like C#.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I'm nervous about being able to keep up with my other classmates.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

2. Game development (any engine)

3. Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

2. Scope management

3. Iteration

4. Object-Oriented programming

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
